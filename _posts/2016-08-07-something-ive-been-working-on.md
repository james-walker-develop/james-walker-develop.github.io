So for our upcoming project at AIE I've been working on a game in VR.

 It involves bartending and shooting so I've been working on the functionality for both of those interactions - here's a gif of an idea I had for how the drinks will be delivered to patrons.

More sweet gif's of this project are coming as I work on it, watch this space.
